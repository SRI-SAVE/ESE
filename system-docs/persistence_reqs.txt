Requirements for persistence of action models, actions, and procedures.

- Abstract persistence service with multiple implementations:
  - WebTAS
  - Standalone, file-based persistence (Adept storage)
  - CPOF

- Different implementations of persistence will implement different
  subsets of its functionality.

- Base functionality (what CPOF implements):
  - Load this application's action model on startup, probably via an
    XML file.
  - Load procedures on demand, based on procedure name. This is
    exposed via the Spine to other clients.

- Extended functionality (needed by non-CPOF editor):
  - Provides a listing of all known procedures by name.
  - Also need to list actions and types by name. Are these three
    separate API methods, or one?
  - Loads action models for other applications.
  - Allows add, replace, and delete of procedures, actions, and types.
  - Do any of these methods need to be exposed via the Spine?
