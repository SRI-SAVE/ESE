These are changes that come as a result of the middleware change and
accompanying action model change. Only changes that are visible to a
consumer of the Bridge API are listed here.

ProcedureExecutor.load() side effects have been removed. It used to be
that loading a procedure using a ProcedureExecutor (especially
SparkProcedureExecutor) would have a side effect of loading the
procedure into the action model, Lumen, and LAPDOG. This is no longer
true. If you want a newly loaded procedure to be executable, you must
make it available via a TypeLoader implementation.

ActionModel methods have different side effects. The addType() and
removeType() methods are still symmetrical, in that they manipulate a
local cache of "permanent" types maintained by the Bridge on behalf of
the application. This cache is available to the learning components in
order to fulfill their functions. However, getType() has an expanded
scope; it now queries the local type cache, followed by any local
registered ActionLoader implementations, followed by any other task
learning components. So it's possible to call removeType() but have
the removed type still be available. Also, getTypes() provides a
listing of only those types which are available in the cache; so
getType() can retrieve types which are not visible in the output of
getTypes().

The TypeName class has moved packages from com.sri.pal to
com.sri.tasklearning.spine.messages.contents.
