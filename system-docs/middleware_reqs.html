  <title>PAL Mediator Requirements</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>These are requirements for the PAL Mediator, which is the
mid-layer that connects the Bridge with Lumen and LAPDOG.</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
  <li>Messaging semantics</li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
    <li>Call-type semantics, where the caller expects a return value or
possibly an Exception</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Execution request Bridge -&gt; Lumen</li>
      <li>Execution request Lumen -&gt; Bridge</li>
      <li>Learning request Bridge -&gt; LAPDOG</li>
      <li>Action model changes (sent to some authoritative Action
Model from a client)<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <li>Notification semantics, which don't expect any response</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Execution status updates for procedures and actions</li>
      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>These could be single-threaded or multi-threaded with
respect to each client.</li>
        <li>These must be delivered in chronological order to each
client, based on dependencies between the notifications. If event B
depends on event A, the client cannot be notified of B until its event
handler method which receives A has returned.</li>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
          <li>"Sub-task start" depends on "parent task start."</li>
          <li>"Task end" depends on "task start."</li>
          <li>"Parent task end" depends on "sub-task end."<br>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <li>Action model changes (sent to all the clients from the
Mediator)</li>
      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>These must be single-threaded with respect to each client.
A client should never be handling more than one of these at a time.</li>
        <li>These must be delivered in chronological order to each
client.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>Action model.</li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
    <li>Contains types. Types include:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Atomic types. Can be represented by java.lang.String.</li>
      <li>List/Set/Bag/PermutableList. These are types that take a
single parameter, e.g., "List of addresses"</li>
      <li>Map. Takes two parameters. Maps one type to another type.</li>
      <li>Tuple. Fixed-length, ordered list of items, where each item
has a distinct type.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <li>Contains actions and procedures. A procedure is a special type
of action, which the action model doesn't necessarily have to
distinguish between.</li>
    <li>Each type or action has a unique name.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Can retrieve a type/action by name.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Can list all types/actions.</li>
    <li>Can add a type/action.</li>
    <li>Can remove a type/action.</li>
    <li>Can attach arbitrary string key/value metadata to a type/action.</li>
    <li>Locking. Any client should be able to try to get either type of
lock:<br>
    </li>
    <ol>
      <li>Exclusive, distributed locks. Exclusive in that no other
party
can get a lock while an exclusive lock is already held. Distributed
meaning multiple resources (Action Model, Lumen, LAPDOG) are all locked
at the same time.</li>
      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>Action model additions</li>
        <li>Action model removals</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Non-exclusive, distributed locks. Non-exclusive meaning that
multiple lockers can lock the same resources at the same time without
intefering with each other. "Don't change the action model while I'm
running this procedure."</li>
      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>Procedure execution</li>
        <li>Procedure learning</li>
        <li>Procedure editing?</li>
      </ol>
      <li>The easiest way to meet this requirement is not through
distributed locks, but instead by having only one copy of the action
model. Any party wishing to do something with an action first acquires
a read lock on the action in the action model. Any party wishing to
delete an action checks that there are no read locks on it, then
acquires a write lock to exclude race conditions involving readers.
Adding new actions should use a write lock also. Changing an existing
action is not supported.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Action model garbage collection. When an action is no longer in
use, we need to detect that condition and remove the action from all
action models.</li>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li>Softening requirement: We don't have to detect it immediately.</li>
      <li>Softening requirement: We can tolerate a few false postiives,
as long as we have locking implemented correctly. The removal will only
happen when there are no procedures running, so no procedures will
break. And the next time somebody executes the procedures, we'll load
it on demand.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>How do we handle inherited actions? If A inherits from B, does
A
include all of B's fields, or does the client have to retrieve B to
fill in those fields?</li>
    <li>All clients receive notification when a type is added or
removed from the action model.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>The client which initiated the add or remove only needs to
hold its lock until the action has been added or removed from the
action model. That means the remove command from the client to the
Mediator must be synchronous.</li>
      <li>The add/remove notifications from the Mediator to the clients
should not be synchronous; otherwise one bad client could deadlock the
whole system.</li>
      <li>Add and remove notifications should be single-threaded as far
as any client is concerned. In other words, there should never be both
an add notification and a remove notification being handled by one
client at the same time.</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>Action execution. This also applies to procedures, which are a
special type of action.<br>
  </li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
    <li>Any client can request that an action be executed. The
requesting client doesn't need to know what other client is responsible
for executing the action.</li>
    <li>The execution request contains the name or some reference to
the action in the action model.<br>
    </li>
    <li>The execution request may contain values for the input
parameters. It's up to the implementing client whether to execute an
action with no input values specified. Input values need to be of the
appropriate type, but the Mediator doesn't have to do any type checking.</li>
    <li>If no client is responsible for handling the execution request,
the Mediator should throw an Exception.</li>
    <li>The execution request should be handled asynchronously. The
requesting client thread should not block until the execution is
complete.</li>
    <li>Each execution request needs to be uniquely identified.</li>
    <li>All clients should receive status updates as the execution
request proceeds.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Start. This notification should include input parameters.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Successful completion. This notification should include
output parameters.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Error. This should include the Exception which caused the
error.</li>
      <li>Cancel. Needs no additional information.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>(optional) Only the client which is executing the request
should be allowed to update the status of the execution.<br>
    </li>
    <li>(optional) It would be nice if the requester could get the
request ID before any status messages are delivered.</li>
    <li>(optional) It would be nice if the requester could listen for
status updates of only one particular request.</li>
    <li>A client needs a way to advertise that it has started a new
execution which it is handling. (As opposed to handling a request from
another client.) This is what happens when Lumen executes a sub-task.</li>
    <li>Each execution request has an optional parent execution
request. Top-level executions have a null parent.<br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li>Ready signal.</li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
    <li>Each client needs a way to signal when it's fully initialized
and ready to handle requests.</li>
    <li>Clients are not considered ready just because they connect to
the Mediator. The must signal readiness.</li>
    <li>The client will not receive any execution requests or execution
status notifications until it signals readiness.</li>
    <li>Should a client receive action model changes before it signals
readiness? If not, should those notifications be queued up until the
client is ready?</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Arbitrary client-to-client calls.<br>
  </li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
    <li>Any client needs to be able to publish an RMI interface that
can be used by other clients. The consumer needs a way to get the
appropriate RMI stub object based on the name of the producer.</li>
    <li>RMIException should be hidden in this interface, to allow for
future transports which would not be based on RMI.<br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li>Keep off the net. Our communications need to exclusively use the
loopback interface, not the external network interface. For RMI, this
means we need to set the system property java.rmi.server.hostname to
"127.0.0.1".</li>
  <li>No cross-JVM class loading. RMI wants to do this, and it has to
be disabled.</li>
  <li>Type information. We need to represent many kinds of types and
actions.</li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
    <li>Simple types, which have a Java class backing them and a
distinct name.</li>
    <li>Aggregate types, which all fit the pattern of
java.util.Collection&lt;T&gt;, where T is essentially another type.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>List</li>
      <li>Permutable list</li>
      <li>Set</li>
      <li>Bag</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Maps, which are analogous to java.util.Map&lt;K,V&gt;.</li>
    <li>Tuples, which are fixed-length lists of items, each of which
has a distinct type.</li>
    <li>Actions, which look a lot like tuples, but don't necessarily
have to be represented the same way.</li>
    <li>Procedures, which look a lot like actions.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Has to be sendable from one JVM to another. This probably means
Serializable.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<h3>Interfaces between Bridge and ITL
code</h3>
<br>
This is a list of the spots where the Bridge depends on ITL
functionality. In other words, these are the things we're going to have
to support int he new middleware layer.<br>
<dl>
  <dt>ActionExecAdapter</dt>
  <dd>Receives exec requests from Lumen, asking for
CPOF actions to be executed. Needs to decode the calling
ActionInvocation,
the called ActionDef, and the input params. Then create a new
ActionInvocation
for the called action, and invoke it. When invocation finishes,
re-encode output params and invocation status and send them back.</dd>
  <dt>ActionInvocation</dt>
  <dd>When its status changes, it broadcasts the new status along with
output params. Is this duplicating what ActionExecAdapter already does?</dd>
  <dt>ActionModel</dt>
  <dd>Gets types out of the ITL type system, and puts new types into
ITL. Needs to work with TypeTranslator, described below.</dd>
  <dt>Bridge</dt>
  <dd>Connects to ITL. Signals ITL that the Bridge is ready. Connects
to the Shell.</dd>
  <dt>ITLExecutionStatusListener</dt>
  <dd>Receives notification of ActionInvocations that have started,
ended, and failed. Decodes input/output parameters and either finds a
cached ActionInvocation or creates a new one.</dd>
  <dt>ITLSystemManager</dt>
  <dd>Starts and stops LAPDOG, Lumen, and ITL Server.</dd>
  <dt>Learner</dt>
  <dd>Connects to the LAPDOG Mediator.</dd>
  <dt>SparkProcedureExecutor</dt>
  <dd>Connects to Lumen. Requests procedure execution. Encodes
procedure name and input parameters. Adds procedures to Lumen
(add_tm_tasks). Receives procedure completion message from Lumen.
Decodes output parameters.</dd>
  <dt>TaskExecutor.</dt>
  <dd>Chooses between SPARK and Lumen. Can probably be deleted.</dd>
  <dt>TypeTranslator</dt>
  <dd>Two-way translator between ITL type representations and Bridge
type representations.</dd>
</dl>
<hr>
<h3>How does the Lumen Mediator interact with ITL?</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>ITLTypeChangeListener</dt>
  <dd>Receives notification of added types and sends the info to
LumenClient.</dd>
  <dt>ITLTypeRemovalListener</dt>
  <dd>Receives notification of removed types and sends the info to
LumenClient.</dd>
  <dt>LumenClient</dt>
  <dd>Adds and removes actions and procedures from Lumen.</dd>
  <dt>LumenTaskExecutorListener</dt>
  <dd>Receives procedure execution requests for Lumen. Publishes status
updates.</dd>
  <dt>LumenTaskResultListener</dt>
  <dd>Sends procedure execution results. Encodes status and output
parameters.</dd>
  <dt>SubTaskExecutionListener</dt>
  <dd>Sends subtask execution results by calling into
ServerConnectionImpl.</dd>
  <dt>LumenCallServiceImpl</dt>
  <dd>RMI class which accepts calls from other ITL clients and makes
calls into Lumen.</dd>
  <dt>LumenProcess</dt>
  <dd>Responsible for starting the Lumen service.</dd>
  <dt>ServerConnectionImpl</dt>
  <dd>Evil god class. Does that make it a devil class?</dd>
  <dt>ConvertTask</dt>
  <dd>Converts task representations between Lumen and ITL forms.<br>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
</dl>
<hr>
<h3>How does the LAPDOG Mediator interact with ITL?
</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>ITL_ServerFacadeImpl </dt>
  <dd>Allows the LAPDOG Mediator to make calls to ITL. Subscribes to
type addition and removal. Checks a type to see if it's an action.
Retrieves types by name. Makes LAPDOG available by registering
LapdogClientCallServiceImpl with ITL.</dd>
  <dt>LapdogClient</dt>
  <dd>Connects to ITL. Accepts type addition and removal events and
delegates them to TypePublicationFacade.</dd>
  <dt>LapdogClientCallServiceImpl</dt>
  <dd>Accepts LAPDOG calls from other ITL clients. Learn and cancel.</dd>
  <dt>LapdogClientProcessManager</dt>
  <dd>Responsible for starting and stopping LAPDOG.</dd>
  <dt>TypePublicationFacade</dt>
  <dd>Converts ITL types to LAPDOG types, and pushes them to LAPDOG via
LapdogFacade.<br>
  </dd>
</dl>
<hr>
<h3>Stuff to save from ITL</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Stuff used to start and stop modules of the system.<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>ITLModule</li>
    <li>ITLServerProcessManager - with changes</li>
    <li>ModuleManager</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Mechanism to differentiate between a failed action and a canceled
one.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>CanceledTaskException</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Anything that uses System.getProperty and friends.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>RMI_MX_PORT - used in RmiMXConnectionFactory to choose a port
number for the RMI registry.</li>
    <li>PAL.disableFinalizer - used in Bridge to determine whether to
run the action finalizer.<br>
    </li>
    <li>itl.module.*.startup - used in ITLModule to control how a
module is started. Probably don't need to preserve this.</li>
    <li>run-with-rmi - used in XPSServerMain to disable use of RMI.
It's hard to imagine using this.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
