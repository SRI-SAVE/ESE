    <b>Requirements for gesture alignment</b><br>
    <ul>
      <li> There are two forms of alignment that must occur - intragesture and intergesture/multigesture.
	Since the latter is somewhat of a contradiction
	in terms, we will use the term <i>idiom</i> as the general term for what is aligned.</li>
       <li>The high level goal is to compose a meaningful idiom, at the
        semantic level the user thinks in, out of lower level actions.</li>
      <li>In addition, we want to name and recognize the most common
        idioms in order to make their visualization easier.</li>
      <li>Less common idioms will be handled as well, though they may
        not have custom names.</li>
      <li>PROPOSED - we defer flagging malformed idioms which indicate gaps in
        the application instrumentation or anti-patterns (see Rationale below).
        Partial recognition of an idiom is the same as nonrecognition of it.
        Idiom prototypes provide no way to inidcate that the idiom reflects an erroneous sequence of actions.</li>
      <li> Intragesture idioms are recognized during demonstration, and visualized as a single unit in the demonstration viewer.
        Multigesture idioms are recognized during learning; their component actions are visualized 
        individually in the demonstration viewer.</li>
    </ul>
    Following are some examples of idioms we need to be able to
    identify. These are intended to be representative, not
    comprehensive:
    <table border=1>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Input actions</b></td>
        <td><b>Output actions</b></td>
        <td><b>Output description</b></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>add [A] to C
          <br>remove [A] from D</td>
        <td><i>same</i></td>
        <td>move [A] from D to C</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>create A
          <br>add [A] to C</td>
        <td><i>same</i></td>
        <td>dispense a new A-type named A into C</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><i>0 or more actions, but nothing that adds A to a
            container</i>
          <br>remove [A] from C
          <br><i>0 or more actions</i></td>
        <td><i>TBD</i></td>
        <td>invalid idiom</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>addPerson [A] to Z
          <br>addVehicle [B] to Z
          <br>remove [A,B] from X</td>
        <td>add* [A,B] to Z
          <br>remove [A,B] from X</td>
        <td>move [A,B] from X to Z</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br>

    <b>Data structures</b><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Idioms take three forms: Idiom prototypes used to identify
        idioms, idiom instances as part of a demonstration, and
        idiom annotations as part of a procedure.</li>
      <li>Idiom prototypes can be represented both in action model XML
        and in ATR. Idiom instances in a demonstration can be
        represented in both Bridge API objects and in ATR. Idiom
        annotations in a procedure can be represented in both Bridge API
        objects (at runtime) and in ATR (as part of the procedure
        definition).</li>
      <li>CPOF will include, in its action model, definitions of idiom
        prototypes which are well known. Not every possible idiom
        prototype is listed here.</li>
      <li>The action model will also allow each action to belong to zero
        or more action classes. Each mapping from an action to an action
        class includes a mapping of parameters as well. TBD whether
        action classes will be defined explicitly or implicitly.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Idiom prototypes allow arbitrary metadata in the form of
        string-string key-value pairs. One likely metadata item could be
        a "malformed" tag to note a idiom as an anti-pattern.</li>
      <li>A idiom prototype consists of a set of action classes,
        action parameters, ordering constraints, and rewriting rules.
        The following examples must be expressible:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>add [A] to C1, remove [A] from C2 -&gt; "move [A] from C1 to
          C2" (Add a meaningful description to a idiom.)<br>
        </li>
        <li>set text to A, set text to B, set text to C -&gt; set text
          to C (Collapse redundant actions.)<br>
        </li>
        <li>add [A] to C1, add [B] to C1, remove [A,B] from C2, add [D]
          to C1, remove [D] from C2 -&gt; add [A,B,D] to C1, remove
          [A,B,D] from C2, "move [A,B,D] from C1 to C2" (Consolidate
          different subtypes of add and remove action classes, unify
          parameter lists, and add a meaningful description.)</li>
        <li>remove [A] from C1, where A is not supported by a previous
          add action -&gt; "invalid idiom" (Recognize a pattern or
          anti-pattern, involving lack of supports, within a
          idiom.)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>A idiom instance contains a series of action instances with
        parameter bindings. It may optionally contain idiom-level
        parameter bindings and name. It contains no metadata.<br>
      </li>
      <li>A idiom annotation in a procedure contains an optional name,
        a set of parameter bindings, and a sequence of action calls. It
        contains no metadata.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <b>Idiom recognition</b><br>

    Here are some specific requirements for idiom recognition:
    <ul>
     <li> Idiom prototypes need not support extraneous actions within idioms.
       That is, arbitrary actions may not be interspersed with the actions that define the idiom.
       Put another way, any action specified in the idiom is part of the idiom.
       It follows that an extraneous action serves to delimit a multigesture idiom.</li>
     <li> Idiom prototypes have an integer property indicating precedence order.
          Higher precedences are matched first; ties are broken arbitrarily.
          Default precedence is 1000 * the number of actions in the template.</li>
     <li> PROPOSED - Assuming idioms will be recognized at demonstration and at execution time, idiom prototypes
       will provide a way to specify that that idiom should be recognized only at demonstration time, or
       only at learn time. Default behavior is to recognize at either time.</li>
     <li> Idiom prototypes specify the individual actions that may comprise the idiom. </li>
     <li> Idiom prototypes specify that certain action parameters must <i>match</i> certain other action parameters.
       This means that the corresponding action arguments must match for the idiom including those actions to be recognized: </li>
       <ul>
	 <li> Matching ignores parameter modes, though it's not expected that any useful idioms will match outputs to outputs
	   or an output to a subsequent input.</li>
	 <li> To match, parameter types must be compatible. Two types are compatible if they are identical or
	   are hierarchically related.</li>
	 <li> Two arguments must be either Java equals() to match, with the exception that a singleton collection of
	   an element <i>e</i> matches <i>e</i>. </li>
       </ul>
     <li> Idiom prototypes identify the parameters of the idiom itself, by designating parameters of its actions
       as idiom parameters. Any parameters that must match for the idiom to be recognized are idiom parameters.</li>
     <li> An idiom prototype is specified to be either <i>ordered</i> or <i>unordered</i>.
       In an ordered idiom, the actions must appear in the demonstration in order.
       In ann unordered idiom, the actions may appear in any order.</li>
     <li> TBD - Should idioms be permitted to be nested, so a prototype could contain a mix of actions and idioms?
       <br> PROPOSED - Don't require support for this, but don't forbid, and support if easy to do so for recognition,
       visualization, and execution.
       Nested idiom recognition would permit, for example, an unordered idiom being included in an ordered idiom,
       allowing a lot more recognition flexibility.</li>
     <li> The intragesture idiom recognition API returns the standard representation for the idiom, including identification of its
       parameters and naming it appropriately. Similarly, learned procedures contain the standard representation
       for recognized idioms intermixed appropriately with actions and loops within the procedure body.</li>
     <li> Idiom recognition must assure that matching values are type-compatible.</li>
     <li> Idiom construction determines types for all arguments of the idiom. These types derive from
           the arguments in the actions comprising the idiom. If a set of arguments match and have different
          types, their closest supertype is used.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <b>Idiom visualization</b><br>

    Here are some specific requirements for idiom visualization:
    <ul>
     <li> All paramaters of all component actions are included in the parameters of the idiom.
           Action parameters that are not parameters to the idiom itself are hidden.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <b>Idiom execution</b><br>

    Here are some specific requirements for idiom execution:
    <ul>
     <li> TBD - Should execution report execution completion of an entire idiom, or of its
       component actions?</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <b>CPOF/Bridge demonstration API</b><br>
    <ul>
      <li>CPOF will send partial demonstrations to the Bridge so that
        idioms can be identified. This is called at the end of each
        idiom.<br>
      </li>
      <li>CPOF will demarcate the start and end of each idiom, as well
        as the constituent actions.</li>
      <li>The Bridge will send back a modified version of the same
        partial demonstration. Actions may be removed or replaced, and
        idiom-level input and output parameters will be listed.
        Idiom-level parameters include parameter name and value. (TBD
        how to avoid duplicating the parameter values in both the
        idiom and individual actions.)<br>
      </li>
      <li>If the idiom matches a known prototype, the Bridge will also
        include the name of the idiom prototype. In this case, idiom
        parameter names will be based on predefined, meaningful names
        associated with the idiom prototype.</li>
      <li>If the idiom matches a known anti-pattern, it's CPOF's
        responsibility to recognize this condition (presumably based on
        idiom prototype metadata) and respond appropriately.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <b>CPOF/Bridge learning API</b><br>
    <ul>
      <li>CPOF will pass a demonstration including idiom instances.</li>
      <li>The Bridge will return a procedure including idiom
        annotations.</li>
      <li>Redundant actions will be eliminated or consolidated in this
      step, rather than as part of the demonstration API.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <b>CPOF/Bridge execution API</b><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Each execution request from the Bridge to CPOF will optionally
        be associated with a unique idiom instance ID and optional
        idiom prototype name.</li>
      <li>If an action failure occurs, the Bridge will abort the
        procedure (and idiom). It's CPOF's responsibility to decide
        how to handle a partially-completed idiom.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <b><br>
      Bridge/LAPDOG demonstration API</b><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Just prior to this call, the Bridge passes LAPDOG all relevant
        idiom, action, and action class definitions in ATR form.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The Bridge passes in the ATR equivalent of the partial
        demonstration received from CPOF.</li>
      <li>LAPDOG returns an appropriately modified partial
        demonstration.</li>

    </ul>
    <br>
    <b>Bridge/LAPDOG learning API</b><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Just prior to this call, the Bridge passes LAPDOG all relevant
        idiom, action, and action class definitions in ATR form.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The Bridge passes in the ATR structures representing the
        demonstration with idiom instances.</li>
      <li>LAPDOG returns an ATR procedure with idiom annotations.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <b>Bridge/Lumen execution API</b><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Before requesting execution of a procedure, the Bridge passes
        Lumen all relevant idiom, action, and action class definitions
        in ATR form, in addition to the definition of the procedure
        itself.<br>
      </li>
      <li>For each execution request from Lumen to the Bridge, Lumen
        includes a unique idiom instance ID. If the idiom is backed
        by a known prototype, the name of that prototype is included as
        well.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>

<h2> Representing gesture boundaries </h2>

We need to work out whether gesture boundaries are represented in the demonstration in each
relevant interface - CPOF->Bridge , Bridge<->IdiomRecognizer, Bridge<->Learner (ie. retain them in the procedure?).

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<h3>Regarding not detecting erroneous idioms</h3>

Discussions with Tim Cummings indicate that, even with significant metadata,
it will be difficult to do robust checking for data loss (aka "poof") action sequences. The main reason is it's
difficult to determine whether the actions are true inverses; there are add/remove action pairs that
are valid idioms but are not "poof" cases:<BR>
 <p>
The following actions take two parameters, the items being added/removed, and the item added to / removed from:
<ul>
<li>addToInbox
<li>removeFromInbox
<li>addItemsToPublish
<li>removeItemsToPublish
</ul>
These actions are modeled as distinct from addTo/removeFromCollection because they have different privilege constraints or role restrictions than the default. Given a gesture that contains an ADD followed by a REMOVE, will the REMOVE be invoked with parameters that make it the opposite of the ADD? The answer to this question requires insight in to the relationships between actions, in terms of their effects. Without that, no amount of insight into privileges or Roles will be of any use.
<p>
We could still do a partial job of detecting data loss from malformed idioms, but it seems better to leave that
work as GD's responsibility.
