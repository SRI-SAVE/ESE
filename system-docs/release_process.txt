To make a release, do the following:

0. Update release notes and change lists for all the modules, and
   check them in to their respective locations.

1. Make sure you're using the build machine, or at the very least, a
   controlled build environment. This means you're sure you have the
   correct version of the JDK with which to compile .class files and
   build .jar files.

2. Build LAPDOG from source, if necessary. LAPDOG comes from
   https://svn.ai.sri.com/svn/lapdog/trunk or one of its
   branches. Check in lapdog-ai.jar to
   https://cmxt.sri.com/svn/tasklearning/trunk/lapdog-client/lib or an
   appropriate branch.

3. Build Lumen from source, if necessary. Lumen's home is
   https://svn.ai.sri.com/projects/lumen/trunk . Check in to
   https://cmxt.sri.com/svn/tasklearning/trunk/itl-server-lumen-support/lib .

4. Check out the Shell's source, which grabs the tasklearning source
   as necessary. The Shell lives at
   https://cmit.sri.com/svn/PAL-CPOF-SHELL/trunk .

5. Run "ant clean" and then "svn status" to make sure you have no
   modified files.

6. Run "svn update" even if you know your source is up to
   date. Otherwise you may end up with an inconsistent version number
   from svnversion.

7. Run "ant dist" to build the release with a name similar to
   pal-1.152.zip.

8. Upload that zip file to the "File Exchange" area of the CPOF/PAL
   Dev wiki at https://projects.esd.sri.com/CPOF-PAL/.

9. Notify Vanessa or other appropriate people at GD that the new
   release is available.
