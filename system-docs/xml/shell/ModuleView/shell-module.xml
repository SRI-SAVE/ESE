<title>Introduction</title>
<para>The PAL Shell is a thin layer for startup and monitoring of
    the various components of the PAL system. It is responsible for
    determining which PAL modules to start, starting them, monitoring
    their status, verifying the continued presence of CoMotion, and
    shutting down the PAL JVM.</para>
<section>
<title>Context Diagram</title>
<para>The Shell exists in the PAL JVM, communicating primarily   
 between RemoteAdmin, the CPOF Bridge via the Spine, and its own 
   Shell Bridge.</para>

<title>ITLShell</title>
<para>The ITLShell class's main method is the entry point into   
     the Shell. This class does the following:         <orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Configure logging if           necessary.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Scrape jar manifests and log their           details.
Specifically, the version information can be useful           in analyzing
bug reports.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Parse command line options, including which      
    learning modules to start.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Connect to RemoteAdmin.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Start the PAL modules (Spine, LAPDOG, Lumen)     
     if configured to do so.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Start watchdogs corresponding to the PAL         
 modules.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Start the Shell Bridge.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>         </para>
</section>
<section>
<title>RAReporter</title>
<para>Responsible for responding to RemoteAdmin pings, this      
  class is streamlined in order to report status information     
   even if the rest of the PAL JVM is not operating correctly. It
        builds its ping response based on atomic values (boolean,
int,         etc.) which are updated asynchronously by the watchdogs
in         other threads.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>ShellToBridgeCallbackHandler</title>
<para>This callback handler receives execution events from the   
     Shell Bridge. In other words, it is informed every time a   
     procedure or action has a significant lifecycle event. Those
        events are start execution, successful completion, completion
        with error, and cancel. Using those events, this class creates
        aggregate statistics and delivers them to RAReporter.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>CPOFWatchdog</title>
<para>This watchdog sends ping requests via the Spine to the     
   Bridge which is attached to CoMotion. If a ping request is not
        answered soon enough, RAReporter is notified. If a longer
        timeout passes without hearing from CoMotion, this watchdog
        initiates a shutdown of the PAL JVM.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>ModuleWatchdog</title>
<para>One instance of this watchdog exists for each PAL module   
     which is running. The watchdog periodically checks that its 
       corresponding module is running, and reports that status to
        RAReporter.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>StatsWatchdog</title>
<para>While not a watchdog per se, this class performs a         similar
function in monitoring indicators of JVM health and         reporting
those to RAReporter. These indicators include heap         size and
thread count.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>LAPDOG stub</title>
<para>If neither LAPDOG nor Lumen is enabled, the Shell will     
   shut down shortly after startup. However, if Lumen is enabled 
       but LAPDOG isn't, then the classes comprising the LAPDOG stub
        will be started. These give appropriate responses to the 
       LAPDOG ModuleWatchdog.</para>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<title>Quality Attributes</title>
<para>The Shell operates in one of three configurations. Most    
commonly, LAPDOG and Lumen are both enabled and run     normally.
Alternatively, Lumen may be enabled but LAPDOG disabled,     in which
case the LAPDOG stub will be activated. Finally, in     extreme circumstances
all modules may be disabled, in which case     the Shell will exit
shortly after starting up.</para>
