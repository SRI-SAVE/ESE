<tgroup cols="2">
<thead>
<row><entry valign="top">Element</entry><entry valign="top">Description</entry>
</row>

<tbody>
<row><entry>Common Task Representation (CTR)</entry><entry>An API
used principally to construct a representation of a learned procedure
  that is shareable among PAL modules, and to decompose it into its
component objects.</entry></row>
<row><entry>CPOF Client (CoMotion, 2D)</entry><entry>The principal
front end of the CPOF / PAL system. Is   variously referred to as
CPOF, CoMotion, or 2D.</entry></row>
<row><entry>LAPDOG</entry><entry>Performs task learning by converting
a     demonstration trace into an executable, parameterized procedure
that     reproduces the demonstrated task as well as generalizing
it so     that the demonstrated task may be executed in the future
to perform     tasks similar to the one that is demonstrated. </entry>
</row>
<row><entry>LAPDOG Mediator</entry><entry>Invokes LAPDOG API methods
in response to messages originating from other components, and   
 sends messages to other compnents in response to return from LAPDOG
API methods.     Doing so isolates LAPDOG from the message-passing
aspects of CPOF-PAL.</entry></row>
<row><entry>Lumen</entry><entry>Executes compoundActions implemented
by procedures       and provides procedure analysis services to the
Procedure Editor.</entry></row>
<row><entry>Lumen Mediator</entry><entry>Invokes Lumen API methods
in response to messages originating from other components, and   
 sends messages to other components in response to return from Lumen
API methods.     Doing so isolates Lumen from the message-passing
aspects of CPOF-PAL.</entry></row>
<row><entry>PAL Bridge</entry><entry>Encapsulates the cumulative API
of the other PAL (non-CPOF)   components. Exists in the CPOF JVM,
and mediates all traffic to the   PAL components in their JVM.</entry>
</row>
<row><entry>Procedure Viewer/Editor</entry><entry>The CPOF-PAL procedure
viewer/editor is a CPOF user affordance that provides         support
users to visualize and to create new procedure by editing an extant
        procedure.</entry></row>
<row><entry>Remote Admin</entry><entry>Part of the CPOF system responsible
for monitoring system   state.</entry></row>
<row><entry>Shell</entry><entry>Container for the PAL components.
The entry point for the PAL   JVM, it starts the other PAL components
(Spine, LAPDOG, Lumen,   mediators). It exchanges status information
with the PAL Bridge   inside the CPOF JVM, and also with Remote Admin.</entry>
</row>
<row><entry>Spine</entry><entry>Message delivery system for communication
between Lapdog, Lumen,   Shell and PAL Bridge</entry></row>
