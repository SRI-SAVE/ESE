<!-- A book consists of a set of chapters. Some of the chapters in the
     SDD document are fully complete files on their own. We insert them
     via the XInclude mechanism. We have not provided complete
     chapters here, but you can see the content in the PDF.
     They are the "boilerplate" for the document, and are
     included like this:
-->


<!-- A chapter can also be constructed of a set of sections. This chapter
     is the heart of the SDD document, and it is constructed by including
     (again, with Xinclude) a set of individual sections.

     This is how the material you provide will be included in the larger
     document. When you deliver the files to us, we will place them into
     our CMS, and then write the include tags that will allow them to
     be processed with material coming from a variety of sources.

     Each view you provide to us should consist of a directory containing
     * The XML view document with a name like
       "cpof_add_module_view_<moduleName>.xml 
     * A subdirectory (called "graphaics") containing the graphics referenced
       by the view document.

     (We have included the directory for the cpof_sdd_module_view_map_provider
     as an example. See the "sample_view_package" directory for details.
     That is the view you see in the PDF included here.)

     As you can see from the Xinclude statements, the directory structure
     mimics the package structure of the source code. The view documents
     are included in an "xml" subdirectory of the source tree, and the
     "xml" directory contains a "graphics" subdirectory. We have found
     this to be a useful convention for maintaining consistency, so
     we recommend it.

<!-- A book can also include appendices and "end matter" like glossaries,
     indices, and so on. They are also included using Xinclude:

     We have provided copies of the glossary and list of acronyms so you
     can see (and use) the terms that are already defined. If you wish
     to add terms, please see the "to_add" files for instructions.
