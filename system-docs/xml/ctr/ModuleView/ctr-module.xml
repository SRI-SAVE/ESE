<section>
<title>Introduction</title>
<para> Common Task Representation (CTR) is an API used principally
to construct   a representation of a learned procedure   that is shareable
among PAL modules, and to decompose it into its component objects.
  This representation is used as the exchange format of procedures
and actions across several   interfaces between PAL modules.</para>
<para> CTR is packaged as part of the Lumen library lumen.jar. CTR
does not, however,   depend on Lumen in order to operate. Lumen has
no dependency upon CTR.</para>

<para> The Common Task Representation elements consist of the various
pieces that comprise a learned procedure that is executable by Lumen. </para>
<section>
<title>Elements and their properties</title>
<para> Elements in the top-level package of CTR provide elements that
are used in several of its subpackages. </para>

a default value. </entry></row>

<para> CTR participates in many interfaces by providing a consistent
representation of   primitive action specificatons and learned procedures
via the ActionDeclaration class.</para>

<row><entry>ActionDeclaration</entry><entry>Class representing learned
procedures, as well as actions that comprise the action model.   
 Objects of this class are exchanged at several points of interface
of PAL components.      Every ActionDeclaration has a signature represented
by a Sig element. Learned procedures     also have an executable component
represented as a TaskExpression element.</entry></row>
<row><entry>Decl</entry><entry>Class providing a map from the name
of a procedure to its ActionDeclaration.     Optionally checks for
name clashes upon construction of an ActionDeclaration;     checking
is be disabled by CPOF-PAL to prevent spurious warnings. </entry></row>

<para>A term in CTR and Lumen represents something that evaluates

<title>Relations and their properties</title>
<para>The primary relation displayed in the Primary Presentation is
the uses      relation, which is a specialization of the depends-on
relation. This      relation asserts that the correctness of one element
depends on that of      another element. Generalization is also shown
where appropriate, asserting      one element is a subclass of another.
Realizations are shown where      appropriate for contextual establishment
of program flow; it should be      noted that not all realizations
are displayed where they do not help with      the understanding of
flow control for the interactions.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Element interface</title>
<para>Common Task Representation provides a data interface in the
numerous system operations that pass procedures or actions among components.</para>
<para>The software interfaces of Common Task Representation are fairly
simple constructors and accessors of the elements shown in the Primary
Presentation.</para>

<section>
<title>Behavioral View</title>
<para>CTR elements provide constructors and accessors for the objects
represented.   They do little or no other processing of data. It serves
as a representation of procedures   that are passed at various points
of interface among the PAL components of   the CPOF-PAL architecture.</para>

<title>Quality Attributes</title>
<section>
<title>Language support</title>
<para> CTR is adequate for representing nearly the full Lumen language.
Only a subset is currently used by CPOF-PAL. If additional language
constructs (e.g., conditionals) are required by CPOF-PAL, CTR will
likely be usable without modification. </para>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<title>Architecture Background</title>
<para>CTR was designed to provide an efficient representation of learned
procedures and actions that is usable by all CPOF-PAL components.
It also provides nearly complete coverage of Lumen, which is repsonsible
for executing procedures represented in CTR.</para>
