  Contains models and views for functions in task learning. Functions implement
  ATRFunction and are primarily used for creating as well as accessing 
  collections and structures.
  <br />
  <br />
  It's worth noting that a list is special in ATR 
  and is not defined as a function and therefore doesn't live in this namespace 
  despite its similarity to several classes within this namespace.
