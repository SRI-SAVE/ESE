  Contains models and views that support 'term-level' entities in a procedure. 
  Term-level means anything that descends from ATRTerm. Therefore, this 
  namespace includes all PUTR (PAL UI Task Representation - an implementation of ATR)
  classes that implement interfaces beneath and including ATRTerm. Appropriate
  views exist for each model. 
  <br />
  <br />
  Terms are generally visualized as menu buttons. The menu options provided 
  by the button allow for general term-level edits such as referencing a
  variable, providing a constant (fixed) value or creating a new procedure 
  input.
  <br />
  <br />
  All functions, which implement ATRFunction and descend from ATRTerm, are
  implemented in the subpackage {@code com.sri.tasklearning.ui.core.term.function}.
