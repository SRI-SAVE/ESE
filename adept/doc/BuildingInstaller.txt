What is this file for?
======================
This file is a readme that describes how to set up your environment
for building packaged Adept installers for the Windows and
Mac environment. A different packaging tool is used for each of
the platforms.


Windows Packager
================
The tool used to create the Windows Adept installer is Nullsoft
(NSIS - Nullsoft Scriptable Install System). Nullsoft is a Windows
only application, so do not go any further if you are on a non
Windows platform!                                                              

0) Run tasklearning/adept/installer> ant setup
1) Download the Nullsoft software from http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page
and install the application.
2) Put the install directory for Nullsoft on your PATH environment
variable (or enter the entire path to the makensis.exe
executable when generating the installer)
3) At a dos prompt, cd to the 'trunk\Adept\installer\' directory where
'Adept' is the directory that contains this project.
4) Run the following command:

  > makensis installer.nsi

This will grab the appropriate jars and script files and produce an
installer.exe. When run, the installer.exe will check for required
software, prompt the user to download and install it if necessary, and
then install Adept.
The installer.nsi file is the script that specifies how to build the installer,
edit this using any test editor to make adjustments to how it works.


Macintosh Packager
==================
The tool used to create the Macintosh Adept installer is IzPack. IzPack
can be installed on any platform to create an installer for any platform.
Currently, only the mac installer has been scripted but it would be
trivial to add support for other platforms (all that is needed is the
correct shortcut/startup script for the target platform).

1) Run tasklearning/adept/installer> ant izpack

This will grab the appropriate jars and script files and produce an
installer.jar. When run, as follows:

  > java -jar dist/adept-installer.jar

the installer.jar tells the user what third party applications are required
but will not detect if they are present or not, or prompt them to download 
them - this will be added at a later time.
The installer.xml file is the script that specifies how to build the installer,
edit this using any text editor to make adjustments to how it works.
