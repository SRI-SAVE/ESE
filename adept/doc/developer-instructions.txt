SETUP

Adept 1.1 does not run under MacOS.

The first time Adept 1.1 is run, it's best to remove the old AdeptTaskLearning directory
under Documents and Settings/%USER%/Application Data/ . Adept will create the appropriate
directory structure.


BUILDING

In file pal-ui/core/src/com/sri/tasklearning/ui/core/EditController.java,
the following flags should be set:

    // #defines...
    public static final boolean WEBTAS = false;
    public static final boolean ADEPT = !WEBTAS; 

To clean and build all Adept components in a SVN working area
of the tasklearning repository rooted at directory $TLROOT:

> cd $TLROOT
> ant clean build


EXECUTION

> cd $TLROOT/pal-ui/adept-ui
> ant run

This will build Adept if need be. If missing class errors occur, it could be that
te WEBTAS/ADEPT flags noted in the previous section are wrong.

A UI window should appear after a few lines on the console.

NOTE: do not use the build file in $TLROOT/adept as it is obsolete.


LOGGING/DEBUGGING

Log file is written to $TLROOT/pal-ui/adept-ui/adept-ui.log.
Default logging is INFO level to console and to this file.
To override defaults, copy the file
  $TLROOT/pal-ui/adept-ui/src/com/sri/tasklearning/ui/adept/adept_ui_log.xml
into $TLROOT/pal-ui/adept-ui, and modify appropriately. This file
will need to be regenerated after a clean.
