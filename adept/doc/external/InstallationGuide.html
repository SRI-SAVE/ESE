<h1> Adept Installation Guide </h1>

 <P>
This is a guide for installing and running the Adept Task Learning system and accompanying Adept-enabled applications.
  <P>
Adept comes with two sample applications:
<UL>
<LI> Image Loader: for loading and manipulating image files.
<LI> Novo: poses puzzles and permits manipulations for solving them.
</UL>

These applications provide a simple environment for illustrating how Adept works.
They are documented in the <A HREF="UserGuide.html">Adept User Guide</A>.
