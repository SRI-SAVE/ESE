<h1> Adept Task Learning System</h1>

<p>The
<A HREF="http://pal.sri.com">PAL</A>
Task Learning component,
called Adept, provides<em> learning-by-demonstration</em>
technology to enable the automation of routine or time-consuming tasks, thus
freeing users to focus on more cognitively demanding activities. </p>

<p>The core of the Adept task learning component system is a module called LAPDOG (Learning
Assistant Procedures from Demonstration, Observation, and Generalization).
Given a demonstration consisting of a sequence of actions performed by a user
to achieve a particular task, LAPDOG generalizes the action sequence into an
executable procedure for achieving similar tasks in the future. LAPDOG
subscribes to a <em>dataflow model</em> in which actions are characterized by
their inputs and outputs, and action outputs serve as inputs to succeeding
actions. Procedure generalization includes ensuring that every action input is
supported by a previous output.</p>

<p>LAPDOG performs <em>parameter generalization</em>, generating a replacement
of constants with variables or (accessor/construction) expressions over variables that reflect the dataflow observed in the
demonstration. This generalization enables procedures to be reused in different
situations and to different effect. LAPDOG also performs <em>structure
generalization</em>, inducing loops over collections of objects by identifying
and generalizing the repeated sequences of actions in the demonstration.
LAPDOG's loop-induction algorithm supports advanced features such as learning
loops over both ordered and unordered collections of objects and loops that
process multiple lists simultaneously. Parameter and structure generalization
are performed synchronously, so LAPDOG can learn loops over collections nested to arbitrary depth, and loops over collections that are the output of
previous loops.</p>

<p>LAPDOG can learn from a single example, through the use of heuristics for
filtering the set of alternative generalization hypotheses to a single best
generalization. But it can also exploit the availability of multiple
demonstrations to improve the quality of the learned procedure.</p>

<p>Learned procedures are executed by the Lumen agent framework, which is derived from the SRI Procedural Agent
Realization Kit (SPARK).  Lumen's hierarchical
representation of tasks combined with instrumentation of task execution makes it possible to teach
procedures that in turn invoke other learned procedures. This task
composition enables incremental development of modular libraries of interdependent
procedures.</p>

 <P> Adept includes an interactive editor that enables users to visualize and modify learned procedures.
   The editor facilitates understanding and sharing of procedures by providing the means for a user to inspect a procedure's structure before executing it. It also permits users to adapt learned procedures quickly rather than demonstrating them again from scratch to incorporate changes. </P>

<P>
Adept is application-independent.
Its use within a particular application requires the definition of an <em>action
model</em> that provides a semantic specification of individual actions in the
application along with implementation of corresponding mechanisms for instrumenting and
automating those actions. In essence, the action model provides the basic
building blocks from which learned procedures are created. Applications
interact with the task learning technologies via a <em>bridge</em> module through
which all communication (i.e., instrumentation events and automation
requests) flows.</p>

<h2><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"">Limitations</span></h2>

<p>
Because of its dataflow model, the PAL task learning
component is well suited to applications whose actions can be framed as
operating on objects in the environment, and the effects of the actions can be
captured in terms of action outputs that generally serve as inputs to succeeding
actions. In its current form, the PAL task learning component is not well suited to
applications whose actions are best captured in terms of their effects on the environment
rather than in terms of the data they produce and consume. This is discussed in the
<A HREF="ClientApplicationGuide.html#ActionModelOverview">Client Application Guide - Action Model</A> section.
