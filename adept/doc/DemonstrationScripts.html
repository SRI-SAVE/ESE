 <P>
This documents contains scripts for operating Adept in order to highlight
(and test) its various capabilities.

Demo centers around the following procedure:
<PRE>
  action 'Demo Procedure'(+'$Email message' = "")
   execute:{
    do 'mozilla.Open email'('$Email message');
    do 'mozilla.Save attachments email'('$Email message', "C:\\Documents and Settings\\Default User\\Desktop\\images\\", '$saved attachments 1');
    forall '$file 1' .in. '$saved attachments 1'
     execute:{
      do 'image.OpenFile'('$file 1', '$image 1');
      do 'image.Resize'('$image 1', "medium (800x600 px)", '$resized image 1');
      do 'image.Save'('$resized image 1', "/my/webpage/");
     };
    do 'mozilla.Go to URL'("http://www.mydomain.org/my/webpage/");}
   argtypes:["Desktop.email"]
   properties:{description:"Save the attachments of an email, resize them to 800x600, and then upload them to flickr.com", terse_task_description:"Demo Procedure"}

</PRE>


Demonstration sequence:
<OL>

<LI> Enable Watch Me

<LI> Dmeonstrate the above on two-attachment email
  [See if one attachment will learn a loop]
  but introduce one or two mistakes

<LI> Turn off Watch Me

<LI> Learn procedure

<LI> [Do we execute this and show failure?]

<LI> Edit procedure

<LI> Fix error(s)

<LI> Execute and show successful completion
</OL>

 <P>
Alternative is to replace the image save with an image upload to a site like Flickr.
Thisis a more compelling demo as it is more realistic, but would involve either
further Firefox instrumentation to handle Javascript, or us building a simple Flickr
uploader app (easy to do as Flickr provides a straightforward API,
but dubious from a demo standpoint).

<br><HR>
<h2><a name="ExtendedDemo"></a> Extended Demo </h2>

Extended demo:

<UL>
<LI> Show creation and demonstration of a nested procedure

<LI>  Procedure validation

<LI>  More extensive editing operations

<LI>  [Flickr] Not logged into website error
<UL>
<LI> had logged in prior to Watch Me
<LI> repair is to log in
</UL>

<LI>  [Future] App or website server down error?

<LI>  [Future] Pecari IP-action insertion [using image properties?]

<LI>  [Future] Procedure library search
</UL>
