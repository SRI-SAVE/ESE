<h1> Adept Developer Guide </h1>

 <P>
This is a guide for developers of Adept.

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

<a href="#Code"> Code Base </a><br>

<h2><a name="Code"></a> Code Base </h2>
 <P>
The Adept system is part of the tasklearning source. This is maintained in the SVN repository
<CODE>https://cmxt.sri.com/svn/tasklearning</CODE>. Adept-specific code such as its shell is
in its <CODE>adept/ </CODE> subdirectory.
 <P>
Adept makes use of many task learning components, including the Bridge and the Spine.
LAPDOG, Lumen, and the Remote XML server (or RemoteXML) are used as well, as are their
respective mediators. In general, these components are used in other task learning
systems such as CPOF-PAL and CALO Express. Developers should be aware of the branching
strategy for the tasklearning and other relevant repositories to assure that inadvertent
changes are not made.
 <P>
Action model for Mozilla is currently under remote-xml-server srouce tree.

<h2><a name="Testing"></a> Testing </h2>
 <P>
<CODE>ant run</CODE> will bring the Adept Shell and all required components up.
Currently, logging is done to the console and is rather busy.
 <P>
To check that browser instrumentation is working, first install the Firefox plugin
at <CODE>remotexml-mediator/plugin/firefox/iris.xpi</CODE>.
Then do an 'ant run' and browse to a URL. You should see something like

<PRE>
     [java] 16600 [XML-RPC-0] DEBUG EXECUTION-LOG  - Invocation ActionInvocation[ActionDef("TypeName[mozilla.OpenUrlEvent]")](0)(null) moving from CREATED to RUNNING, args [http://www.yahoo.com/]
     [java] 16600 [XML-RPC-0] DEBUG com.sri.pal.GlobalActionNotifier  - Adding invocation of ActionDef("TypeName[mozilla.OpenUrlEvent]")
</PRE>

 <P>
To test if learning is working for a one-action demonstration, visit a URL in the browser.
Now, since there is no GUI in place to indicate that the demonstration is over, a hack
has been put in place to do so. Visit a URL containing the string <CODE>".sri.com/~"</CODE>
for example, <CODE>http://www.ai.sri.com/~tomlee/</CODE> . This will initiate learning;
you should see the learned procedure in the log:

<PRE>
     [java] 22388 [LapdogClientCallServiceImpl thread 0] DEBUG com.sri.ai.tasklearning.lapdog.CommonTaskRepresentation  - Learned Lumen action+procedure:
     [java] action 'SPARK.demo1'(+$url_1 = "http://www.yahoo.com/")
     [java]  execute:{
     [java]   do 'mozilla.OpenUrlEvent'($url_1);}
     [java]  argtypes:["mozilla.url"]
     [java]  properties:{creator:"user unknown", demonstrated_variable_bindings:{url_1:"http://www.yahoo.com/"}, learner:"LAPDOG", learner_version:"Beta 5.0", registration_date:"20100825T234846Z"};
     [java] 
</PRE>

<H1>Misc notes to be reorganized</H1>

Point of maintenance for agave.xml is tasklearning/bridge/src/com/sri/pal.
 <P>
Point of maintenance for mozilla action model is remotexml-mediator/src/java/remotexml_model.xml
 <P>
Chris, I'll suggest that you pass metadata to LAPDOG via a defineType() property. This method only takes strings as properties, not attribute/value pairs. So I suggest we encode the needed info, and any other metadata of this type should it arise, as "inverse=INVERSEACTIONNAME". In this case we should see "inverse=findLinkRef" on findLinkName's defineAction() and vice versa. Is that right Melinda? 
 <P>
THIS DIDN'T WORK: For the short term, I can put in an equivalence hack: When we define a new type to LAPDOG, we'll first check to see if a type exists with the same name, but in the agave namespace. If so, we'll claim that they're equivalent.
 <P>
 Chris--if I want to avoid loading certain agave actions (because we don't need them for the demo), is it sufficient to comment out the corresponding lines in the LapdogClientCallServiceImpl?  I.e.,

        agaveActions = new ArrayList<TypeName>();
        agaveActions.add(new TypeName("string", AGAVE_NAMESPACE));
        //agaveActions.add(new TypeName("stringlist", AGAVE_NAMESPACE));
        agaveActions.add(new TypeName("findLinkRef", AGAVE_NAMESPACE));
        agaveActions.add(new TypeName("findLinkName", AGAVE_NAMESPACE));
        //agaveActions.add(new TypeName("createStringFromFormatString", AGAVE_NAMESPACE));
        //agaveActions.add(new TypeName("createFormatStringFromString", AGAVE_NAMESPACE));




 <P>
To terminate Adept, ctrl-C in its shell works, or kill the process using the OS.
