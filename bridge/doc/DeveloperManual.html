<h1>PAL Bridge Developer Manual</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
The PAL Bridge system consists of the following components:<br>
<ul>
    <li>The target application (e.g. CPOF, WebTAS)</li>
    <li>LAPDOG for Task Learning</li>
    <li>Lumen for procedure execution</li>
    <li>Bridge API for adapting PAL components for target
    application</li>
    <li>Spine to route messages between the PAL components</li>
</ul>
<h3>Architecture</h3>The PAL Bridge system is a client-server
architecture. The server component, the Spine, can exist either in its
own JVM, or in the client's JVM.

<h3>Integration Overview</h3>
<p>The following list gives a high-level overview of what needs to be
done to enable PAL-Bridge-based Task Learning in an
application.
<ul>
    <li><i>Action Model Instrumentation</i>
        <ul><li>Develop an action model, which is the set of atomic
                operations that a user may perform. A simple learned
                task consists of a sequence of these actions. Each
                action has input parameters (objects upon which the
                action operates) and output parameters (artifacts the
                action produces or side effects). The action model
                also includes the definition of types that are
                specific to the target domain. It is important that
                the action model be specified at the correct semantic
                level: The level at which the user thinks about and
                interacts with the system.
            <li>Formalize the action model into an XML descriptor
                file. While it's possible to dynamically define the
                action model using the PAL API, this is not
                recommended except for special cases.
            <li>For each action in the action model, the target
                application must provide both instrumentation code to
                report the occurrence of the action (a sensor) during
                the task learning phase and instrumentation code to
                reproduce the action (an effector) during task
                execution. <b>Producing the instrumentation code is
                typically the largest part of the work to integrate
                task learning.</b>
        </ul>
    <li><i>User Interface</i>
        <ul><li>The PAL-Bridge system does not provide a user
                interface. (SRI does have a standalone task learning
                system which provides a UI, but that system is beyond
                the scope of this document.) The target application
                must provide a user interface to do the following (at
                a minimum):
                <ul><li>Initiate and control task learning
                    <li>Provide access to previously-learned tasks
                    <li>Initiate task execution
                </ul>
        </ul>
    <li><i>API Integration</i>
        <ul><li>Write code to use the PAL-Bridge APIs for task
                learning and execution. This involves implementing a
                variety of interfaces, depending on what functionality
                is desired.
            <li>Write code to provide persistence of learned tasks.
        </ul>
</ul>

<h3>The Bridge API</h3>
<p>See the <a href="api/com/sri/pal/package-summary.html">com.sri.pal
package javadoc</a> for a good introduction to the Bridge API, or read
on:
<p>The main entry point for the target application in the Bridge API
is the <code>Bridge</code> class. This class instantiates and/or
connects to the other PAL components, and it provides the API for
registering various application listeners and services. The
application should consider implementing some or all of the following:
<ul>
    <li><code><a href="api/com/sri/pal/ActionExecutor.html">ActionExecutor</a></code>
        - provides the application's callback facility for procedure
        execution. When a procedure needs to perform an action in the
        application, it will call this interface. Multiple
        implementations of this interface can be registered to handle
        distinct subsets of the action model, if necessary.
    <li><code><a href="api/com/sri/pal/ActionInvocationStatusListener.html">ActionInvocationStatusListener</a></code>
        - allows the implementor to track the status of a
        single <code>ActionInvocation</code>
        or <code>ProcedureInvocation</code>, usually the latter.
    <li><code><a href="api/com/sri/pal/TypeStorage.html">TypeLoader</a></code>
        - provides persistence of stored procedures and potentially
        offline applications' action models.
    <li><code><a href="api/com/sri/pal/GlobalActionListener.html">GlobalActionListener</a></code>
        - allows the application to be notified of any procedures or
        actions which are executed.
    <li><code><a href="api/com/sri/pal/InstrumentationControl.html">InstrumentationControl</a></code>
        - allows for selective enabling/disabling of instrumentation
        when multiple applications are sharing the same PAL backend
        for cross-application learning.
    <li><code><a href="api/com/sri/pal/ProcedureExecutor.html">ProcedureExecutor</a></code>
        - In some cases, the application may implement this in
        addition to <code>ActionExecutor</code>. If the application
        provides access to an embedded scripting language, where a
        string containing source code is used to define a new action,
        then this interface is appropriate.
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the application integration developer may wish to
look at some of the PAL classes available for representing application
data types:
<ul>
    <li><code><a href="api/com/sri/pal/PrimitiveTypeDef">PrimitiveTypeDef</a></code>
        - holds primitive values such as string or int.
    <li><code><a href="api/com/sri/pal/EnumeratedTypeDef">EnumeratedTypeDef</a></code>
        - for enumerated types.
    <li><code><a href="api/com/sri/pal/CustomTypeDef.html">CustomTypeDef</a></code>
        - for application types which can't easily be represented
        using combinations of the other types. A custom type needs a
        way to map between its string representation and its Java
        object representation. See the javadoc for that class for more
        implementation notes.
    <li><code><a href="api/com/sri/pal/ListDef.html">ListDef</a></code>
        - ordered collection of other objects.
    <li><code><a href="api/com/sri/pal/SetDef.html">SetDef</a></code>
        - unordered collection of other objects with no duplicates.
    <li><code><a href="api/com/sri/pal/BagDef.html">BagDef</a></code>
        - unordered collection of other objects with duplicates
        allowed.
    <li><code><a href="api/com/sri/pal/StructDef.html">StructDef</a></code>
        - for structured objects with named, typed fields.
</ul>
The container types can be nested within each other arbitrarily
deeply.
<p>The target domain is defined by an action model in an XML file. The
action model is loaded the first time a given application runs by
calling one of the <code>ActionModel.load()</code> methods, at which
time the action model data will be written to persistent storage. The
action model <a href="examples/ActionModel.xsd">XSD</a> and
<a href="examples/actions_test.xml">an example</a> are available.

<h3>Adapting the System to a New Application Domain</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Create a new XML action model. Schema for the XML is
        at <a href="examples/ActionModel.xsd"><code>examples/ActionModel.xsd</code></a>.
    <li>Start the PAL components, if not running in a separate JVM
        (<code>Bridge.startPAL()</code>).
    <li>Create an instance of the PAL Bridge
        (<code>Bridge.newInstance()</code>).
    <li>To instrument the effectors, implement
        the <code>ActionExecutor</code> interface.</li>
    <li>Register your <code>ActionExecutor</code>
        using <code>ActionModel.registerExecutor()</code>.
    <li>Register your action model with the PALBridge. (one time only)
        <code><pre>
                ActionModel am = Bridge.getActionModel();
                am.load(url, executor, NAMESPACE);
        </pre></code>
    <li>To learn a procedure from a demonstrated sequence of user
        actions, call <code>Learner.learn()</code>.
</ol>

<h3>Details, Hints, and System Properties</h3>
<ul><li>The PAL components use
        <a href="http://www.slf4j.org/">SLF4J</a> for logging. SLF4J
        can send messages to log4j, java.util.logging, or other
        logging frameworks. Ensure that exactly one of the logging
        framework binding jar files
        (e.g., <code>slf4j-log4j12-1.5.11.jar</code>) is on the
        classpath.
    <li>LAPDOG can write output files which are very helpful
        in diagnosing learning failures. This may be enabled by
        setting the system property <CODE>lapdog.output.directory</CODE>
        to the desired directory. Relative paths are relative to the
        system's working directory.
    <li>LAPDOG may be configured to name variables using an arbitrary separator
        string between the stem and trailing integer of variable names. By default
        this string is the underscore (_). This may be configured by
        setting the system property <CODE>lapdog.naming.variable.separator</CODE>
        to the desired string (the empty string is allowable).
    <li>LAPDOG's ability to learn loops can be disabled by setting the
        system property <code>lapdog.disable-loop-learning</code>.
    <li>By default, PAL uses JMS on port 61616. This can be changed by
        setting the system property <code>PAL.JmsMessageBrokerPort</code>.
    <li>By default, the secondary JMS Spine used by the Bridge to
        connect to the PAL backend will retry existing subscription
        requests to the primary Jms Spine 10 times. This can be
        changed by setting the system
        property <code>PAL.SubscriptionAttempts</code>.
    <li>By default, the secondary JMS Spines will wait 5000ms before
        retrying existing subscription requests to the primary Jms
        Spine. This can be changed by setting the system
        property <code>PAL.SubscriptionInterval</code> in
        milliseconds.
    <li>By default, the PALBridge will wait 60,000ms before assuming that
        the Shell has died. Thi can be changed by setting the system property
        <code>PAL.ShellPingDelayTimeout</code> in milliseconds.
    <li>For debugging, action model logging can be enabled by setting
        the system property PAL.actionModelLogDir to the name of a
        directory to log action model fragments into.
</ul>
