Lumen Jan 29 release

Summary:
========
Contains the basic Lumen interpreter and interface code for communication with the CPOF bridge via ITL Server.


Known Bugs:
===========

None


Known Limitations:
==================

None that affect CPOF/PAL performance of procedures learned by LAPDOG.


Future Improvements:
====================
- The locations of errors involving expressions should be reported in a more informative way.

- Some problems in the interface to the bridge are logged as errors rather than throwing exceptions.

- The Lumen runtime stack of failures needs to be reported (in an informative way).

- Lumen currently implements a very simplistic, hard-wired meta-level that does not provide any reasoning
  over missing or multiple procedures.

- Some built-in operator declarations are weaker than they should be, resulting in code that passed
  validation, but is found to be invalid at runtime.

- Captured variables in closures are not currently implemented (and will be implemented in a different way
  from SPARK).
